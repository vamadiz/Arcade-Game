BUGGER! A spin on the classic arcade game Frogger!

The object of this game is to avoid the bugs going across the screen and reaching the water at the top of screen. Simple! Just move your character by using the left, right, down, and up keys. If you touch a bug you are to start again.

To run this game find the index.html file in the project folder and open it with your preferred web browser.

Good luck!
